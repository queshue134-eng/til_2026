A Study on Korean Occultism in ExhumaThe film Exhuma (Pamyo) functions as a masterclass in two major pillars of Korean tradition: Pungsu-jiri (Geomancy/Feng Shui) and Muism (Korean Shamanism).1 It uses these systems to tell a story about historical trauma.2+1I. Pungsu-jiri: The Science of the EarthIn the film, the land is not merely dirt; it is a living biological entity. The prosperity of the living depends entirely on how they treat the "body" of the land.The Concept of "Myo-baram" (Grave’s Wind):This is the inciting incident. The film posits that a grave is a conduit. If an ancestor is buried in "akji" (vile ground)—such as a waterlogged or cursed hole—their spiritual distress transmits a specific frequency of misfortune to their direct lineage, usually striking the firstborn son.The Tiger and the Spine (Baekdudaegan):To understand the villain's motive, one must visualize the Korean peninsula. In folklore, the land is shaped like a crouching Tiger.The Baekdudaegan mountain range is the tiger’s "spine" or energy artery.The Iron Stake Theory: The film dramatizes the real historical conspiracy that Imperial Japan drove iron spikes into these energy meridians (specifically the "waist" of the tiger at 38.3417° N) to sever the flow of Qi, effectively paralyzing the nation's spirit.II. The Mechanics of Shamanism (Muism)Unlike Western exorcism which often relies on prayer, Korean Shamanism is a "transactional" and "physical" battle.The Shaman as a Vessel:Characters like Hwa-rim and Bong-gil are "possessed" shamans (Kangshin-mu). They do not just talk to spirits; they allow spirits to enter their bodies.Defense: The tattoos (Scripture of Tae-eul-bo-gyeong) act as a containment field to prevent the spirit from consuming the host's ego.Safety: The topknot (Sangtu) locks the "Baekhoe" energy point at the crown of the head.The Arsenal of Elements:Salt: Used for Defense. It creates a sterile "Mandala" or sanctuary that impurities cannot cross.Glutinous Rice & Horse Blood: Used for Offense. It burns the spirit on contact due to the high "Yang" (fire/life) energy.The Pig (Daesal Ritual): A decoy strategy. By offering 5 pigs, the shaman attempts to trick the spirit into attacking the animals instead of the 5 human workers.III. Taxonomy of SpiritsThe film distinguishes sharply between "Native" (Korean) and "Invasive" (Japanese) entities.FeatureGwis-in (Korean Ghost)Oni (Japanese Demon)NatureA human soul filled with resentment (Han).A physical monster; a corpse fused with an object.FormIntangible. Possesses people or haunts dreams.Corporeal/Physical. Can crush skulls and leave footprints.WeaknessCan be soothed, cremated, or fed.Cannot be soothed. Must be destroyed elementally.MotivationPersonal (Hunger, Cold, Anger at family).Military (Following orders, guarding territory).The "Nure-onna" (Snake Woman): The presence of this Japanese Yōkai was the first clue that the grave was "territory" claimed by a foreign power.IV. The Historical AllegoryThe film is ultimately a story about the unfinished business of the Japanese Occupation (1910–1945).3The "Fox" (Gisune): Represents the cunning of the Japanese occultists (specifically Murayama Jijun) who tricked Koreans into burying their dead in cursed spots.The "Tiger" (Korea): The land that was severed.The Coordinates: The grave was not a resting place; it was a military coordinate. The "Grandfather" (a collaborator/Chinilpa) was used as a human shield to hide the "General" (the Iron Stake) beneath him.The Resolution: The main characters (named after Independence Fighters) literally "exhume" this traumatic history.4 By destroying the Oni with the tools of the "Grave Robbers" (failed patriots) and the coin of Admiral Yi Sun-shin, they finally end the war that had been festering underground for a century.V. The Elemental Logic (Wu Xing)The final confrontation is a logic puzzle based on the Five Elements.The Problem: The Oni is Metal (Sword/Stake) and Fire (Spirit).The Failure: Normal wood weapons burn (Fire eats Wood).The Solution: Wet Wood.Water extinguishes Fire.Water makes Wood grow.5Water rusts Metal.6By soaking the wood in blood and dark soil (Yin/Water properties), the Geomancer created a weapon capable of shattering the Metal demon.
