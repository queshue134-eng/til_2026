### Key Takeaways

- **EUV Lithography is the pinnacle of human engineering** — Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines are the most complex machines ever built, costing over $150 million each and requiring trucks to transport.

- **Transistors are now measured in nanometers** — Modern chips pack billions of transistors at scales of 3-7nm, smaller than the wavelength of visible light, requiring entirely new manufacturing approaches.

- **Light manipulation at extreme scales** — EUV uses 13.5nm wavelength light, generated by vaporizing tin droplets with powerful lasers 50,000 times per second, creating plasma that emits the required UV light.

- **Mirror perfection is critical** — The mirrors used in EUV machines must be atomically smooth. If the mirror were scaled to the size of Germany, the largest bump would be 1mm tall.

- **This technology enables everything digital** — Without these machines, the smartphones, computers, and AI systems we rely on would be impossible. ASML is the only company in the world that can make these machines.

### Code / Implementation

While transistors are hardware, understanding binary logic is fundamental. Here's a simple demonstration of how transistors enable logic gates:

```python
# Simulating basic transistor logic gates
# Transistors act as switches: ON (1) or OFF (0)

def AND_gate(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool:
    """Two transistors in series - both must be ON for current to flow."""
    return a and b

def OR_gate(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool:
    """Two transistors in parallel - either can allow current to flow."""
    return a or b

def NOT_gate(a: bool) -> bool:
    """Inverter - output is opposite of input."""
    return not a

def NAND_gate(a: bool, b: bool) -> bool:
    """Universal gate - can build any logic circuit from NAND gates."""
    return not (a and b)

# Example: Building a half-adder from basic gates
def half_adder(a: bool, b: bool) -> tuple[bool, bool]:
    """
    Half adder: adds two bits
    Returns (sum, carry)
    """
    sum_bit = a ^ b  # XOR: true if inputs differ
    carry = a and b  # AND: true if both inputs are 1
    return sum_bit, carry

# Demonstration
print("Half Adder Truth Table:")
print("A | B | Sum | Carry")
print("-" * 20)
for a in [False, True]:
    for b in [False, True]:
        s, c = half_adder(a, b)
        print(f"{int(a)} | {int(b)} |  {int(s)}  |   {int(c)}")
```
