# 2026-01-01 TIL: Korean Occultism & Folklore in Exhuma (2024)

## Category: Cultural Studies / Korean Folklore

### Film Reference

**Exhuma (파묘, Pamyo)** — 2024 Korean Horror/Thriller

### Key Takeaways

The film _Exhuma_ is a masterclass in two major pillars of Korean tradition: **Pungsu-jiri** (Geomancy/Feng Shui) and **Muism** (Korean Shamanism). It uses these systems to explore historical trauma from the Japanese Occupation.

#### 🏔️ I. Pungsu-jiri: The Science of the Earth

- **The Land as a Living Entity** — In Korean geomancy, the earth is biological. The prosperity of the living depends on how ancestors are buried.
- **Myo-baram (Grave's Wind)** — A grave in "akji" (vile ground) transmits misfortune to descendants, especially the firstborn son.
- **The Tiger & The Spine (Baekdudaegan)** — Korea is envisioned as a crouching tiger. The Baekdudaegan mountain range is its spiritual spine.
- **The Iron Stake Theory** — Historical conspiracy that Imperial Japan drove iron spikes into Korea's energy meridians (at 38.3417° N) to sever the nation's Qi.

#### 🔮 II. The Mechanics of Muism (Korean Shamanism)

Unlike Western exorcism (prayer-based), Korean Shamanism is **transactional and physical**:

| Element                           | Purpose                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tattoos** (Tae-eul-bo-gyeong)   | Containment field to prevent spirit possession                  |
| **Topknot** (Sangtu)              | Locks the Baekhoe energy point at the crown                     |
| **Salt**                          | Defense — Creates a sterile mandala impurities cannot cross     |
| **Glutinous Rice & Horse Blood**  | Offense — Burns spirits with high Yang (fire/life) energy       |
| **Pig Sacrifice** (Daesal Ritual) | Decoy — Tricks spirits into attacking animals instead of humans |

#### 👻 III. Taxonomy of Spirits

| Feature        | Gwis-in (Korean Ghost)                    | Oni (Japanese Demon)                            |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Nature**     | Human soul filled with _Han_ (resentment) | Physical monster; corpse fused with object      |
| **Form**       | Intangible, possesses or haunts           | Corporeal, leaves physical marks                |
| **Weakness**   | Can be soothed, cremated, or fed          | Must be destroyed elementally                   |
| **Motivation** | Personal (hunger, cold, anger)            | Military (following orders, guarding territory) |

The **Nure-onna** (Snake Woman) — a Japanese Yōkai — was the first clue that the grave was "territory" claimed by a foreign power.

#### 🇰🇷 IV. The Historical Allegory

The film is ultimately about the unfinished business of the **Japanese Occupation (1910–1945)**:

- **The Fox (Gisune)** — Represents cunning Japanese occultists who tricked Koreans into burying dead in cursed spots
- **The Tiger** — Korea, the land that was severed
- **The Coordinates** — The grave was a military coordinate, not a resting place
- **The Resolution** — Main characters (named after Independence Fighters) literally "exhume" traumatic history

#### ⚔️ V. The Elemental Logic (Wu Xing)

The final confrontation is a puzzle based on the **Five Elements**:

```
Problem: The Oni is METAL (Sword/Stake) + FIRE (Spirit)
Failure: Normal wood weapons burn (Fire eats Wood)

Solution: WET WOOD
├── Water extinguishes Fire
├── Water makes Wood grow
└── Water rusts Metal

→ Wood soaked in blood + dark soil (Yin/Water properties)
  = Weapon capable of shattering the Metal demon
```
